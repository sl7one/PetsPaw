# Pets Paw

This is a "Pets Paw" test project for MACPAW. Written to demonstrate my abilities.

The site is an adaptive application for viewing, adding, voting and favouriting cat pictures. You have the opportunity to watch a random cat, search for them by breed, providing information about the breed itself. You can also save favorites, likes and dislikes cats.
